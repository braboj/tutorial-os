== 1. Hardware Basics

=== CPU
The CPU is the brain of a computer system and it is where the program is
executed. The design of a system starts with the CPU and determines the choices
of the bus and peripherals explained below.

The CPU consists of several parts

- Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
- Control Unit
- Registers


=== Bus

==== Control bus
This is the set of signals that is used to synchronize the activities of the
separate computer components. Some of these control signals, such as RD and
WR are sent by the CPU to the other elements to tell them what type of
operation is currently in progress. The I/O elements can send control
signals to the CPU. An example is the rest input (RES) of the CPU
which, when driven LOW, causes the CPU to reset to a particular
starting stare.

==== Address bus
This is a unidirectional bus, because information flows over it in only
one direction, from the CPU to other system components.

When the CPU wants to communicate with a certain memory location or I/O device,
it places the appropriate address code onto the address bus. The devices listen
on the address bus and if one of them recognizes its address it will respond to
the CPU request.

==== Data bus
This is a bi-directional bus, because data can flow to or from the CPU.

=== Register
=== Interrupt

Interrupts are a way to stop the current program execution and to jump to a
special program called an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**. The interrupts
are an efficient mechanism used by I/O devices to signal that there is data
available and relieve the processor from constant polling of the I/O device status.

The interrupt service routines can interrupt tasks and take control immediately.
This could be quite detrimetral to the time constrains of the RTOS and this
is why interrupts must be used with caution and be as quick as possible.

The interrupts themselves can be also nested. An interrupt ca never be
interrupted by an interrupt of lower or equal priority. If two different
interrupts occur at the same time the one with the higher priority gets
executed first.

The first job of the interrupt should be to store the registar values of the
CPU and the last job should be to restore these values.

=== Memory
=== Peripherals


== 2. Operating Systems

=== 2.1. Overview

- manages how I/O devices communicate with the application (Chapter 1)
- offers a structural approach to develop applications (Chapter 2)
- offers a scheduler to allocated CPU time to different tasks (Chapter 3)
- offers a set of services for intertask communication (Chapter 5, 6)
- manages how the memory is organized and how it is allocated (Chapter 7)


=== 2.2. Classification

image::assets/OS-Classification.png[640, 480]

The are several differentiation criteria used to classify the operating system.
If we take the access to the CPU in cosideration, then the operating systems
is be classified as ...

- A **single-task OS** that allows a single task to use the CPU
- A **multi-tasking OS** that allows the execution of multiple tasks on a
single CPU

Further operating systems might be further differentiated based on the number
of users such as ...

- A **single-user OS** allows only a single user to use the OS
- A **multi-user OS** allows multiple users to use the OS

And finally based on their use case, the operating systems might be divided
in the following categories ...

- **General-purpose OS** that ensures the execution of all tasks without
blocking (fairness)

- **Real-time OS** that ensures the execution of high priority tasks within a
strict time limit (deterministic)


Embedded systems are electronic devices that have a microprocessor but are not
computers and usually have a very specific purpose. Such systems are for
example the electronic control unit (ECU) of the car, smart TV, etc.

Embedded systems often use real-time operating systems, which execute
critical code within strict time constraints. If the constraints are not met
then this would be considered a failure. This kind of systems have the
advantage to be predictable (deterministic). This can be especially important
in measurement and automation systems where downtime is costly or a program
delay could cause a safety hazard.


=== 2.3. Components

image:assets/OS-Structure.png[]

==== 2.3.1. HAL

Many operating systems such as Linux or Windows are written in such a way
that they work without knowledge of the underlying hardware. This is achieved
by separating the interface from its implementation. The OS will only use the
interface. Depending on the usecase either the OS developer or the hardware producer
is responsible to implement the low level code accessed by the HAL API. These might
be register mappings, low level drivers, etc.

==== 2.3.2. Kernel

The kernel is the main component of the operating system. It is responsible
for the allocation and partition of the sytem memory, the scheduling and switching
of the tasks and provides objects and services for taks synchronization and communication.
In many cases the kernel also provides device drivers to access common hardware such as
memory, UART,

==== 2.3.3. Middleware

The middleware provides some additional features to the operating system, which
are very common but not strictly required for the OS to work. These might include
networking services, file system and graphics libraries. The middleware can be
easily extended by the user providing own interfaces and libraries.

==== 2.3.4. OSAL

The OSAL (OS Abstraction Layer) is considered to be part of the middleware. It
allows the users to write applications, which might be ported to other operating
systems by separating the interface and the concrete implementation of common
kernel services, such as semaphors, mutexes and others. In the **UNIX** world
it is also named **POSIX**.

== 3. Task Management

=== 3.1. Task Concept

A task is typically an infinite loop which never terminates. It is a
self-contained program which runs as if it had the microprocessor all to
itself.

Depending on the operating system a task can be understood as a thread or a
process. Threads are tasks that share the same address space, while processes
have their own address space.

image::assets/OS-TaskModel.png[800, 600]

=== 3.2. Task States

The minimum set of states in typical task state model consists of
the following states ...

1. **Running** (takes control of the CPU);
2. **Ready** (ready to be executed);
3. **Waiting** (blocked until an event occurs ).

The following graphic shows several examples of popular operating systems to
illustrate the common and specific tasks states...

image::assets/OS-TaskStates.png[800, 600]

=== 3.3. Task Scheduling

Schedulers determine which task to be executed at a given point of time and
differ mainly in the way they distribute computation time between tasks in
the READY state. The scheduler is one of the core features of the OS kernel.
Technically it is a program which is exectuted periodically. The period
between the executions is also called the **system tick**.

==== 3.3.1. Round-Robin

image::assets/OS-Scheduling-RoundRobin.png[800, 600]

With round-robin scheduling each task gets a certain amount of time or **time
slices** to use the CPU. After the predefined amount of time passes the
scheduler deactivates the running task and activates the next task that is in
the READY state. This ensures that each task gets some CPU time.

- No starvation effect as all tasks are executed
- Best reponse in terms of average reponse time accross all tasks
- Low slicing time reudces CPU efficiency due to frequent context switching
- Worser control of the timing of critical tasks

==== 3.3.2. Priority scheduling

image::assets/OS-Scheduling-Priority.png[800, 600]

With priority scheduling tasks are executed by their assigned prority.
Usually lower numbers mean higher priority.

- Good for systems with variable time and resource requirements
- Precise control of the timing of critical tasks
- Starvation effect possible for intensive high priority tasks
- Starvation can be mitigated with the aging technique or by adding small delays

==== 3.3.3. First Come First Served

image::assets/OS-Scheduling-FirstComeFirstServed.png[800, 600]

With this type of algorithm tasks are executed in order of their arrival.
It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.

- Simple implementation
- Starvation effect possible if a tasks takes a long time to execute
- Higher average wait time compared to other scheduling algorithms

==== 3.3.4. Shortest Job First

image::assets/OS-Scheduling-ShortestJobFirst.png[800, 600]

With SJF tasks with shorter execution time have higher priority when
scheduled for execution. This scheduling is mainly used to minimize the
waiting time.

- Starvation efect possible
- Best average waiting time
- Needs an estimation of the burst time

=== 3.4. Task Switching

==== 3.4.1. Task Structure

Typically each task consists of folling parts...

- Task code
- Task variables
- Task stack
- Task control block (TCB)

The taskâ€™s stack has the same function as in a single-task system: storage of
return addresses of function calls, parameters and local variables, and
temporary storage of intermediate results and register values. Each task can
have a different stack size.

The **Task Control Block (TCB)** is a data structure assigned to a task when it
is created. The TCB contains status information for the task, including the
stack pointer, task priority, current task status (ready, waiting, reason for
suspension) and other management data. Knowledge of the stack pointer allows
access to the other registers, which are typically stored (pushed onto) the
stack when the task is created and each time it is suspended. This
information allows an interrupted task to continue execution exactly where it
left off. TCBs are only accessed by the RTOS.

Internally the OS will save the TCBs of all stacks in a dynamic list, which
might be changed on-demand if the OS allows creation of tasks in runtime.

```
TODO: Image illustrating the TCB and how it is chained
```


==== 3.4.2. Switching in the multi-threaded model

In the multi-threading model, which is predominatly used in RTOS the task or
context switching is simplified the change of one set of CPU register values to
another set of CPU register values.

image::assets/OS-Multi-Threaded-Switch.png[800, 600]

Switching algorithm:

1. Push the registers, variables on the stack of the current task
2. Push the stack pointer on the TCB of the current task
3. Load the stack pointer from the TCB of the new task
4. Load the registers and variables stored on the new task's stack

Some operating systems allow tasks to be interrupted by other more important
tasks. This is called a **preemptive** context switching and is the dominant
mechanism used in RTOS. The other type of switching is called **cooperative**
and in this case the task must explicitly release the CPU before another task
can take control.

==== 3.4.3. Switching in the multi-process model

For multiprocessor systems each process has its own address space and cannot
address the memory of the other processes. The context switch requires the
re-configuration of a special chip called MMU (Memory Management Unit). The
role of the MMU is to map the process address space to the address space of
the physical memory.

```text
TODO: Picture with an explanation how the MMU works
```

==== 3.4.4. Switching in the lightweight process model

The multi-process model is much more complex and time consuming and thus not
very useful for RTOS. If a MMU is present, the RTOS might use only to protect
other memory areas from being accessed by the current task. This model is
also called **"Thread Protected Mode"** or **"Lightweight Process Model**".

```text
TODO: Picture to illustrate how to use MMU to protect memory areas
```

==== 3.4.5. Concurrency vs Parallelism

The process of sharing one CPU among many tasks and thus creating the
illusion of parallel work is called **concurrent execution**. The process of
running tasks on multiple processors is called **parallel executuion**.

image::assets/OS-Concurrent-vs-Parallel.png[800, 600]


== 4. Synchronization Problems

Tasks are a very convinient way to modularize the development process and
optimize the CPU utilization using concurrency. But they also come with a price
when several tasks have to exchange data. The simplest way to achieve this is
by using the **shared memory model**.

image::assets/OS-Shared Memory.png[800, 600]

The shared memory can represent a counter, which needs to incremented by every
task or a buffer used to store messages exchanged by the tasks. Each of the
problems described in this chapter arise when using the shared memory model.

// ============================================================================

=== 4.1. Race condition

Very often a resource must be used by only one task in order to produce the
correct result. For example if several tasks require the printer then the
result will be often a random sequence of characters depending on the scheduled
execution of the tasks.

A similar example can be given with a shared variable instead of a printer.
Let's assume that a task must write a value to a counter variable, which will
be shared among several tasks. As in the printer scenario, a task might actually
produce an invalid value depending on the offset in the execution time of the
tasks.

image::assets/OS-Race-Conditions-1.png[800, 600]

The counter is supposed to be incremented 4 times but due to task interleaving
the final values is incorrect. The main problem appears to be that the
several operations are needed to increment the value of the counter and the
scheduler is not aware of this.

This is a problem if **atomicity** meaning the operations cannot be executed in
one processor cycle. This is a very common situation and one of the main reasons
why race conditions occur. In the example above 3 operations are needed to
update the value of the counter: **read, modify and write**.

Another possible context for race conditions is the **read, check and act**
scenario. In the example below the second task will be terminated by an
exception as Task B will try to remove an element from the global list, which
was already removed by task A in the previous cycle.

image::assets/OS-Race-Conditions-2.png[800, 600]

To avoid race conditions we must define the access to the shared resource is
to define a critical section, which cannot be interrupted by other tasks.
Critical sections can be defined by using **locks**, **semaphores** or
**mutexes**. The disadvantage of this approach is the impact on the performance
as the critical section can be used only by one task.

image::assets/OS-Race-Conditions-3.png[800, 600]

A second option would be to refactor the code to use a local resource instead of
a shared one. This technique is also called **state separation**. In this case
object oriented programming is very useful as objects can store local data.
This will avoid the critical section and this increase the program efficiency.

Additionally the objects might exchange information by using the message
passing technique. For example an object might broadcast its state on an event
and other objects might act accordingly. The processes as in  It is the
foundation of many formal modles used to analyze concurrent systems such as
the **actor modell**, **pi-calculus** and others.

For example the number Pi might be approximated using random numbers. The more
numbers are generated the better the approximation will be. The formula for the
approximation is **pi = 4 * (i / n)**, where i is the number of point in the
circle with radius 1 and n the total number of points generated.

image::assets/OS-Monte-Carlo.png[600, 400]

**Solution 1** : Shared counters

The first solution to this problem using tasks is to distribute the counter
generation accross several tasks and use critical sections to protect the
shared variables i and n. This of course is no better than running a single
thread and provides no performance improvement.

    t = threading.Thread(target=generate_points, args=[10000, ])
    t.start()

----

**Solutuon 2**: Separate state through objects

A second options would be to change the calculation model. When we look at the
formula we see that pi can be split without relying on a shared state. The
formula can be changed to **pi = 4 * (i1 + ... + ik) / (n1 + ... + nk)**. This
means that we can create k threads and sum their respective values for i and n
to calculate the value of pi. Thread 1 will generate i1 and n1, thread 2 will
generate i2 and n2 and so on. When all threads are ready executing the value
of pi will be calculated with the new formula above.

The examples above are given in Python. Unfortunately Python will also not
perform much better than solution 1 as it locks the interpreter though the
**Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**. It basically means that only one thread can
be executed on a single processor. This makes threads in Python more suitable
for tasks requiring long waiting, for example user input or data from the
network. There are some third party libraries which can circumvent the usage
of the GIL lock. One of them is **Numba** which comes with a
**Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler.

**Solutuon 3**

In this solution the calculation will be distrubuted among several processors.
They might be on the same machine or physically separated. The initiator will
send a message to the processors to start the calculation. When a processor
finishes its work it will send a message to all the participants to update their
counters and that it ended its operations. When all the processors sent messages
that indicate end of operation, then the initiator will take the result from the
last processor. There are several protocls, which are very suitable for message
passing concurrency such as **MQTT**. A notable framework using this protocl is
**RabbitMQ**.

image::assets/OS-Race-Conditions-4.png[800, 600]

// ============================================================================

=== 4.2. Mutual exclusion

In the previous section it was mentioned, that there are special synchronization
objects used to solve the race condition problem by defining a critical section.
These objects generally solve the **mutual exculsion problem**.

By definition mutual exclusion guarantees that one thread never enters a
critical section while another thread is using it. The requirement of mutual
exclusion to solve race conditions on shared data was first defined by Dijsktra.
He is also the first to propose a solution called **semaphore**.

Processes requiring mutual exclusion have several parts. It is obligatory to
access the shared resource always using a mutual exclusion algorithm and to
release the resource after the work is done in the critical section. A simple
diagram illustrating this is given below.

image::assets/OS-Mutual-Exclusion.png[]

First the process will enter the **non-critical section**. At a certain point
of time the process will need to access the shared resource and it will call a
special function, which will try to claim the exclusive rights.

If the exclusivity can be guaranteed then the process continues to the
**critical section**, where it performs operations on the shared resource.
After this the process must leave the critical section and release the resource.
In practice it is desirable to implement the critical section to execute as
fast as possible.

The simplest solution of the mutual exclusion problem is to disable all
interupts for the crticial section. This can be though only applied on single
processor systems and has the disatvantage of introducing non-determinism,
which can be a serious issue for real-time operating systems.

The next best implementation is based on hardware and uses the **busy-waiting**
technique combined with special **atomic processor instructions**. These
instructions cannot be interrupted and usually require one processor cycle to
be executed.

There are also several algorithms solving the mutual exclusion problem, which
typically use the busy-waiting technique. The follwing algorithms are
recommended for further reading:

- Dekker's Algorithm
- Peterson's Algorithm
- Lamport's Algorithm
- Szymanski's Algorithm
- Maekawa's Algorithm

A developer will typically use the solutions provided by the operating system
as they are omptimized and often solve some additional problems arising during
thread synchronization.

// ============================================================================

=== 4.3. Deadlock

After solving the problem with race conditions and mutual exclusion, another
problem might arise when using synchroinziation objects such as mutexes or
semaphores. In some special instances when multiple tasks lock multiple
shared resources and form a lock loop waiting for each. In real life these
problems are often know as *the chicken or the egg* problem.

The illustration below demonstrates a typical deadlock scenario. We have an
elevator, which for simplicity can be used only in one direction and must be
shared between two persons. Each one of them wants to go to a specific floor and
do their work.

image::assets/OS-Deadlock-1.png[]

Let's suppose the two person enter the elevator at the same time
and behave selfishly. The person called Branko will press the up button to start
the elevator, but Mitko being selfish will press the stop button, because he
thinks he has higher priority. Branko of course will not release the up button
because he thinks too he has thehighest priority. In this scenario both persons
will stay blocked indefinitely.

Based on the example above, the formal definition of a deadlock is a situation
on a shared resource that can arise if and only if all of following conditions
are met. These conditions are also called **Coffman conditions**.

1. Mutual exclusion : At least one resource uses a mutual exclusion algorithm
2. Hold and wait : A process is holding a resource and waiting for resources
used by other processses
3. No preemption : A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process
holding it
4. Circular wait : Each process must be waiting for a resource being held by
another process

==== 4.2.1. Deadlock prevention

If we take the scenario above one way to break the Coffman conditions is to make
one or more persons less selfish and so one of them go up after a certain time.
This is the equivalent of breaking the hold and wait from the Coffman
conditions (2). It is thus recommended always to used **lock timeout** if the
operatings system or the compiler supports it.

image::assets/OS-Deadlock-2.png[]

A second solution is to put rules how to use the buttons and each person is
obliged to follow these rules. For example the only required rule in this
situation is always first to press the direction button and then the stop
button. In this scenario when both person enter the elevator, the first one
pressing the up button will be also the one pressing the stop button. This
scenario breaks the circular wait (4) from the Coffman conditions. It is also
a form of a **resource hierarchy** protocol.

image::assets/OS-Deadlock-3.png[]

A third solution would be to use an intermediate person to operate the elevator.
For simplicity it will service the persons based on their arrival time. If in
the example arrives first and the Mitko, then the operator will first go to the
floor required by Branko and then Mitko. The elevator operator formally is known
formally as the **arbitrator**. It also breaks the circular wait condition (4).

image::assets/OS-Deadlock-4.png[]

All of the examples above tried to break one of the Coffman condiotns. Every
solution which achieves this is also called a **deadlock prevention** algorithm.
There is also a solid fundamental research on this topic using a more
generalized example called the **dining philosophers problem**.

image::assets/OS-Deadlock-Dining-Philosophers.png[]

In the example above the forks are the shared resource and the plate in front
of the philisophers is the critical section. The philosophers can either think
or eat. Edger Dijkstra, William Stallings and Chandy and Misra proposed
effective solutions to the this problem.

==== 4.2.2. Deadlock detection and avoidance

Another way eliminate a deadlock is to ensure that resources are allocated
in such a way that a deadlock cannot occur. In this case the operating system
must continuously monitor the current system state and determine whether with
the next resource allocation a deadlock is imminent. This process is called
**deadlock detection and avoidance**.

Notable tools here are the **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)** and **Banker's
algorithm**. The disadvantage of this solutions is that the process must
communicate its resource requirements in advance. The **Abassi RTOS** offers
this kind of protection.

    TODO: Graphic

==== 4.2.3. Deadlock detection and recovery

The third option is to allow deadlocks, detect them and implement a recovery
strategy. This process is called **deadlock detection and recovery**.
The most common detection algrorithms are the **Wait-For-Graph** and the
**Safety Algorithm**. The deadlock recovery can be optimistic where one or more
resource will be preempted and allocated to other processes or pessimistic
where the OS will terminate one or in the worst case all tasks.

    TODO: Graphic

// ============================================================================

=== 4.4. Starvation

Starvation is a problem encountered in concurrent computing where a process
is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work. The priority
scheduling is a typical scenario where this situation might occur. It involves
one or more high priority tasks which run frequently and hinder other low
priority to run. The difference between starvation and deadlock is that
starvation usually means gaining control after a long time but not indefinite.

The solution to the starvation problem is pretty straightforward. For one a
a minimal delay in the high priority tasks will allow other tasks to regain
control sooner.

    TODO: Show diagram with the scheduler to illustrate the delay solution

Another solution is to use the so called **task aging
technique**. The OS queues all tasks requiring access to the resource. The
longer the tasks stays in the queue the higher its priority will become until
it takes control.

// ============================================================================

=== 4.5. Priority Inversion

Priority inversion is a scenario in scheduling in which a high priority task
is indirectly superseeded by a lower priority task effectively inverting the
assigned priorities. The illustration below exemplifies a typical situation
with priority inversion.

image::assets/OS-Priority-Inversion.png[800, 600]

1. A Low Priority Task (LP Task) owns a resource
2. A High Prioriy Task (HP Task) waits for the resource taken the the LP task
3. A Medium Priority Task (MP Task) becomes ready and preempts the LP Task.
4. The MP Task completes execution.
5. The LP Task resumes
6. The LP Task finishes using the resouce and releases the semaphore
7. The HP Task acquires the semaphore and resumes

In the scenario above the MP basically preempted the HP tasks. It appears as if
the priority of the HP and LP task are the same.

There are several solutions of the problems described above. For example some
operating systems implement the **priority inheritance** technique.

image::assets/OS-Priority-Inheritance.png[800, 600]

1. A Low Priority Task (LP Task) acquires a resource
2. A High Prioriy Task (HP Task) waits for the resource from the LP task
3. The priority of the LP task is elevated to that of the HP task
4. A Medium Priority Task (MP Task) becomes ready
5. The LP Task is temporary with higher priority and resumes
6. The LP Task finishes using the resource and release the mutex
7. The LP Taks has its original priority restored
8. The HP Task acquires the resource and resumes
9. The HP Task finishes using the resource and releases the mutex
10. The MP Task is scheduled for execution


== 5. Synchronization Objects

=== 5.1. Flag, Signal or Event

Flags, signal or events are used to control the program flow and do not define
critical sections. They represent just a simple way of intertask synchronizing
the tasks program flow.

=== 5.2. Semaphore

Semaphore is an integer variable which is used as a **signaling mechanism**
to allow a process to access the critical section of the code or certain
other resources. A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented
by each `acquire()` call and incremented by each `release()` call. The
counter of the semaphore can never go below zero and when `acquire()` finds
that it is zero, it blocks, waiting until some other task calls `release()`.

The semaphores are typically acquired by the priority ordering of the tasks.
Upon releasing the semaphore the kernel determines the highest priority task
waiting for the semaphore and passes it to the task. If the task releasing
the semaphore is of higher priority than the task waiting for the semaphore,
then the releasing task continues executing with its non-critical section.
Otherwise the releasing task is preempted and the kernel switches to the
waiting task.

Often semaphores are categorized by the value of the integer variable in the
semaphore. **Binary semaphores** are used to access a single resource, while
**counting semaphroes** stores the number of free instances of a said resource
and blocks until an instance becomes available.

=== 5.3. Mutex

A mutex or the mutual exclusion service is a special type of **locking
mechanism** which is based on the binary semaphore. Instead of using the
priority of the task the mutex will queue the order of the access to the mutex
object. The first to request the mutex will also gain it independent of its
priority.

It also implements an algorithm called **priority inheritance** to solve a
common problem of semaphores called **priority inversion**.


=== 5.4. Condition variable

Condition variables will usually wait until something is true and then gain
exclusive access to a shared resource. It can be tought as a combination of
a flag and a mutex object. It is usually used to synchronize access to a
shared queue and thus solving the reader-writer problem.


=== 5.5. Mailbox

- A mailbox is a **message buffer** managed by the RTOS.
- The messages have **fixed data size** and are usually small.
- Mailboxes work as **FIFO** (first in, first out)
- Tasks can **send and retrieve** messages to/from the mailbox
- If the **mailbox is empty the reading task be blocked** for a specified
amount of time or until a message arrives.
- When a message arrives the **kernel notifies the waiting task** and the
scheduler determines if a task switching must be done, according to the
priority of the running task and the task waiting for a message

=== 5.6. Queue

- Queues are **message buffers**
- Queues accept **messages of different lengths**.
- The **message size must be passed as a parameter** along with the message.
- Tasks can **send and retrieve** messages to/from the queue
- If the **queue is empty the reading task be blocked** for a specified
amount of time or until a message arrives.
- When a message arrives the **kernel notifies the waiting task** and the
scheduler determines if a task switching must be done, according to the
priority of the running task and the task waiting for a message

=== 5.7. RWLock

A reader-writer lock allows simultaneous access for read-only operations
while write operations require exclusive access.

Multiple tasks can read at the same time, but a writing task will block
others from reading or writing. A readers-writer block can also be
implemented using semaphores and mutexes.


=== 5.8. Spinlock

Spinlocks are similar to locks but the thread is not suspended. They are useful
to reduce the rescheduling and context switch overhead and mostly useful for
threads which are expected to be interrupted for only a short period of time.

=== 5.9. Barrier


== 6. Memory management

```commandline
TODO: Image of the points below
```

- static for global and static variables
- stack for local variables
- heap for dynamic allocation
- Explain some important concepts such as memory initialization and NULL

```commandline
TODO: Image of the points below
```

- Explain the function of the linker
- Take a look at a program (for example .com, .exe or .elf)
- Explain how the program is loaded in to the memory

== 7. Best practices

- Each task is to be considered an application of its own
- Initialize shared resources before task creation
- Separate system diagnostics and fault detection into a separate task
- Use RTOS to monitor task health
- Evaluate potential system failures and recovery strategies
- Use design patterns to improve maintenance and development

---

- Optimization of functions (3 parameters, 4 bytes)
- Semaphore is a check, Mutex blocks

---

The main() function will not be interrupted by any of the created tasks
because those tasks execute only following the call to OS_Start(). It is
therefore usually recommended to create all or most of your tasks here, as
well as your control structures such as mailboxes and semaphores. Good
practice is to write software in the form of modules which are (up to a
point) reusable. These modules usually have an initialization routine, which
creates any required task(s) and control structures. A typical main()
function looks similar to the following example:

```commandline
void main(void) {

  // Initialize embOS (must be first)
  OS_Init();

  // Initialize hardware for embOS (in RTOSInit.c)
  OS_InitHW();

  // Call Init routines of all program modules which in turn will create
  // the tasks they need ... (Order of creation may be important)
  MODULE1_Init();
  MODULE2_Init();
  MODULE3_Init();
  MODULE4_Init();
  MODULE5_Init();

  // Start multitasking
  OS_Start();
}
```
